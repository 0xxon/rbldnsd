rbldnsd (0.99.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * implemented master format dump for ip4trie dataset

  * removed all references to osirusoft.com

  * switch to integer TTL everywhere

  * PACK32S() and PACK16S() aka stpcpy() (incrementing destination)

  * $NS records change: accept all NS in single line or in multiple
    lines

  * increase dataset reading line length from 512 bytes to 8k to
    allow large list of nameservers in one $NS record

  * use ns records from FIRST dataset (with non-empty $NS) only

  * add new dataset to the end of a list, not to top (cosmetic change,
    specifies loading order and thus logging order only)

  * disallow zero TTL in command line

  * reworked duplicate RR detection and choosing of minTTL.
    Fix TTL even when we have exactly the same RR in packet already.

rbldnsd (0.990pre0) unstable; urgency=low

  * ensure we return all RRs of the same type (if there
    are several of them) with the same (smallest) TTL.
    Problem spotted by Victor Duchovny, MorganStanley.

  * "randomize" order of RRs of the same type in `generic'
    dataset. The randomization is dumb, but it is better
    than nothing anyway.  Suggested by Furio Ercolessi.

rbldnsd (0.99) unstable; urgency=medium

  * autoconf-style configuration.  Run ./configure before make.
   - #include "config.h"
   - uint32_t
   - STATS_LL => uint64_t/long long/long, PRI_DNSCNT: PRIu64/llu/lu
    Thanks to Christian Krackowizer for testing and patience.
  * change ip4addr parsing routines to return -1 in case of error,
    instead of 0, and treat 0 to be valid return value too (0/0)
  * fix utimes printing (time rbldnsd spent when loading zones)
  * move VERSION[_DATE] extraction from Makefile to configure,
    made Makefile depend on debian/changelog.
  * debian/rules: do not attempt to make distclean if there's no
    Makefile
  * another config test: <sys/select.h> (NOSELECT_H)
  * some mods to ip4trie
  * cast [ug]id_t to int for printf
  * config test for vsnprintf(), fatal if not found for now (OSF lacks it)
  * remove EasynetDynablock2rbldnsd.pl since easynet.nl provides dynablock
    in rbldnsd format now.
  * remove osirusoft2rbldns.pl since relays.osirusoft.com is dead.
  * made zonelist really global in rbldnsd.c, reorder some globals to
    be in one place, add some more comments
  * Fixed range parsing.  E.g., 24.217.64-191 did not work (and any range
    like this where last two bits where xored into 255)
  * allow logging to standard output (-l - or -l +-)
  * move logfile handling a bit earlier in the init process, and
    do not send initialization messages to stdout in case we're
    logging queries there (-l -)

 -- Michael Tokarev <mjt@corpit.ru>  Tue, 16 Sep 2003 21:33:35 +0400

rbldnsd (0.98) unstable; urgency=low

  * use memmove() instead of memcpy() for overlapping regions,
    even if dstaddr is less than srcaddr (current memcpy() can
    deal with that, but this is out of spec and future versions
    may do some more optimizations that'll break things)
  * made init_zone_caches() to work for a list of zones, not just
    a single zone, and move a call to this routine from newzone()
    to init().  Fixes a memory leak in combined dataset (caches
    was allocated but never used/freed).
  * properly (but still ugly) fix stats counting
  * some "ugliness": use more const's and explicitly declare routines
    wich does not accept any arguments as such to be foo(void)
    (Marco D'Itri md at linux.it)
  * handle version.bind CH TXT (and version.server for that matter)
  * return REFUSED instead of FORMERR in case unrecognized query
    class (IN,ANY,etc) requested
  * defttl => def_ttl to be consistent with def_rr
  * set ttl for version.bind to be 0
  * warn about truncating TXT records.  Change interface of parse_a_txt()
    to include a line number
  * TXT RR is 255 bytes max, not 254 (generic dataset)
  * wildcards in dnset: *.example.com and example.com works as before,
    but .example.com is now interpreted as BOTH *.example.com and example.com.
  * clarifications in manpage: dataset vs zone
  * fix logging to various destinations (LOGTO_* constants, vdslog())
  * allow to specify multiple listening addresses.
  * recognize -b host:port and [ip]:port syntax (only host previously)
  * -b option is now mandatory
  * do fork() early in the initialization process so that logging will
    have proper pid tag. This also slightly simplified init routine.
  * made array of listening sockets to be global
  * added ip4trie (experimental) dataset: set of IP4 CIDR ranges.
  * yet again, fix CIDR parsing (mask vs ~mask)
  * fix ip4trie common length calculation in case diff == 0
  * fix dslog() to use vprintf, not printf

rbldnsd (0.97b) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed security bug in per-zone statistic counting.
    Thanks Marco D'Itri (md at linux.it) for pointing this out to me.

 -- Michael Tokarev <mjt@corpit.ru>  Wed,  6 Aug 2003 03:20:36 +0400

rbldnsd (0.97a) unstable; urgency=medium

  * recognize and ignore "in" in `generic' dataset, as in:
     example.com 1D IN A 127.0.0.1
  * do not truncate addresses in CIDR like 1.2.3.4/24 to 1.2.3.0/24
    in ip4range()
  * fix a bug in ip4set_parse(): propagate error return properly

 -- Michael Tokarev <mjt@corpit.ru>  Fri,  1 Aug 2003 13:43:28 +0400

rbldnsd (0.97) unstable; urgency=low

  * even better mempool align arith
  * remove some dnlen usage (only tiny slowdown of zone reloads)
  * use switch(firstchar) in ds_special()
  * return SOA first to ANY queries
  * Also return NS in AUTH in ANY queries inside base zone (cosmetic)
  * add SOA/NS even before all other recs when queried base DN
  * combined dataset optimization: try to reuse datasets from previous
    load instead of reallocating them on every reload to preserve
    statistics collected by subdatasets
  * in some rare cases, dnset missed one RR for a DN with multiple RRs
  * -DRECOGNIZE_IP4IN6 - treat reverse IPv6-mapped IPv4 queries as
    plain IPv4 qieries
  * Wirehub Dynablock => Easynet Dynablock
  * -DSTATS_LL to use long longs for statistic counters
  * per-basezone statistic counters
  * corrections of various spelling errors in manpage, great thanks to
    Bert Driehuis (driehuis{at}playbeing{dot}org) for this.

 -- Michael Tokarev <mjt@corpit.ru>  Sun, 13 Jul 2003 03:19:56 +0400

rbldnsd (0.96) unstable; urgency=high

  * renamed almost all structures and variables, to be more accurate:
     struct dataset => struct dsdata  (dsd)
     struct zonedataset => struct dataset (zds => ds)
     struct zonedatalist => struct dslist (zdl => dsl)
     struct zonefile => struct dsfile (zf => dsf)
     struct dataset_type => struct dstype (dst)
     dataset_types[] => ds_types[]
     zds_loading => ds_loading
     struct dnsqueryinfo => struct dnsqinfo (qi)
     connectzonedataset() => connectdataset()
     zds_special() => ds_special()
   and so on.

  * reworked NS and SOA internals, to use more natural data structures
    (no more ugly packing of several fields into one char[])

  * always assume that SOA and NS refers to zone's base DN -
    less work for DN compression routines

  * precompute SOA and NS records (pack various fields, pre-compress
    domain names) for faster response time

  * return NS records if available in AUTHORITY section of positive
    replies

  * restore MX functionality that was broken for quite some time.
    Note that currently, MX records aren't compressed

  * do not lowercase domain names used in NS, SOA and MX records.
    Add dns_dnequ() routine, remove dns_dntol() call from parse_dn().

  * pre-initialize zone caches when creating zone structure (before
    startup) - both to avoid memory fragmentation and to ensure all
    the required memory is allocated.

  * Only add NS records if reply contains some data

  * Add NS AUTH record for queries to base zone too (when not asked for NS)

  * simplify and clarify warning about too long NS or SOA RRs

  * remove zlog()

  * Moves:
     dslog() &Co from rbldnsd_zones.c to rbldnsd_utils.c
     dntoip4addr() from rbldnsd_utils.c to rbldnsd_packet.c
     ds_loading from rbldnsd_zones.c to rbldnsd.c

  * fixed alignment bug in mempool.c that caused allocation slip

  * simplify dssoa allocation

 -- Michael Tokarev <mjt@corpit.ru>  Thu, 29 May 2003 12:46:37 +0400

rbldnsd (0.95) unstable; urgency=low

  * Portability: #include <netinet/in.h> for sockaddr_in definition in
    rbldnsd_packet.c

  * Allocate dataset to be part of zonedataset -> remove dataset's allocfn

  * Added `combined' dummy dataset

  * Change loading routines: ds_loadfn become ds_startfn and ds_linefn,
    ds_linefn is now passed via zonedataset to readdslines.  Preparations
    for combined dataset.

  * Implemented `combined' dataset, with many changes all other the places

  * Notes, TODO items updated

  * Fixed problem with DN compression introduced in recent changes.

  * cleanup of #include's

  * change names of zsoa, zns to reflect content more accurately

  * align argument for mp_alloc(), to align object(s) to sizeof(int).
    This allows to eliminate one mempool in combined dataset.

  * use varlen zns_ttldn[]

  * use one memory pool for all nested datasets in combined dataset

  * add additional argument to ds_resetfn_t - freeall boolean, to
    free all the memory instead of just zeroing it - needed for
    combined dataset, but not currently used anyway

  * in ip4set, remember size of previously allocated array to
    avoid unnecessary realloc()s

  * made ip4mask() to be an indexed array access to ip4addr_cidr_netmasks[]

 -- Michael Tokarev <mjt@corpit.ru>  Tue, 27 May 2003 22:18:20 +0400

rbldnsd (0.94) unstable; urgency=low

  * implemented -d option (dump zone data in BIND format to stdout)

  * data loading warnings goes to stderr instead of stdout

  * Makefile portability tweaks for Solaris

  * recognize ';' as comment char in addition to '#'; also, officially
    recognize comments after an entry (IP address or domain name) in
    ip4set and dnset

 -- Michael Tokarev <mjt@corpit.ru>  Mon, 26 May 2003 17:49:27 +0400

rbldnsd (0.93) unstable; urgency=low

  * reverse change made in 0.91: SOA TTL, when SOA is in AUTHORIRY
    section, should be set to MINTTL field of SOA itself.

 -- Michael Tokarev <mjt@corpit.ru>  Sun, 18 May 2003 19:05:38 +0400

rbldnsd (0.92) unstable; urgency=medium

  * bugfix: fixed SOA screwup introduced in 0.91

 -- Michael Tokarev <mjt@corpit.ru>  Sat, 17 May 2003 05:24:39 +0400

rbldnsd (0.91) unstable; urgency=low

  * print version info at build time (Makefile)
  * made SIGNALLED_* names action-, not signal-dependant
  * allow compilation without IPv6 (-DNOIPv6)
  * free addrinfo structure for bind address (not a real leak: it used once)
  * rotate nameserver records (simple cyclic rotation)
  * do not reallocate memory for dataset headers on every reload
  * fixed glitch in dnset - min DN labels was always 0 (tiny speedup only)
  * fixed default A RR to be 127.0.0.2, not 2.0.0.127
  * added a note about absolute vs relative domain names into manpage
  * allow to specify a unit (s, m, h, d, w) for all time values
  * changed default ttl to be 35m
  * use ISSPACE/SKIPSPACE everywhere
  * use PACK32/PACK16 everywhere
  * some more variants of parse_{time,uint32}
  * use parse_time() for -c option too
  * always use SOA's TTL when SOA is included in answer
  * added RPM .spec file

rbldnsd (0.89p4.ip6) unstable; urgency=low

  * IPv6 transport support.  Default is to try any,
    specify -6 or -4 to select IPv6 or IPv4.

  * -a (ACL) and -L (log ACL) options are gone for now,
    because there is no IPv6 versions.

 -- Michael Tokarev <mjt@corpit.ru>  Thu,  8 May 2003 21:24:02 +0400

rbldnsd (0.89p4) unstable; urgency=low

  * NXDOMAIN elimination is gone.  Bind9 does that too, so I assume
    it is correct behaviour.  Many code removed.
  * Another prerelease.

 -- Michael Tokarev <mjt@corpit.ru>  Thu,  8 May 2003 21:24:02 +0400

rbldnsd (0.89p3) unstable; urgency=low

  * $NS in datasets
  * $TTL in datasets generic records; now required for $SOA and $NS
  * $n substitutions
  * more details in NEWS

rbldnsd (0.89p2) unstable; urgency=low

  * again, many changes.  DN-based lists are now ok too from
    BIND point of view.  Logging improvements.  See NEWS file.

 -- Michael Tokarev <mjt@corpit.ru>  Tue,  6 May 2003 03:33:37 +0400

rbldnsd (0.84p2) unstable; urgency=low

  * rewrote query parsing routine to be much more accurate (see
    version 0.83 change entry) and a bit faster.
  * cleanups, cleanups.
  * return definitive answer to AAAA, PTR and CNAME queries.  A
    hack for now, seeking for a better way...

 -- Michael Tokarev <mjt@corpit.ru>  Tue, 29 Apr 2003 04:29:02 +0400

rbldnsd (0.83) unstable; urgency=high

  * critical buffer overflow fix in dns query parsing code.
    Initial code (0.1 version) was right, but it was rewritten
    in 0.2 - the bug was here since 0.2!..  Ughhh!..

 -- Michael Tokarev <mjt@corpit.ru>  Sat, 19 Apr 2003 05:24:09 +0400

rbldnsd (0.83p1) unstable; urgency=low

  * -DNOSTDINT_H to use <sys/types.h> instead of <stdint.h> for uint32_t.
  * changed slightly "zone loaded" message
  * added minimal access control (-a netlist option)
  * added query log filter (-L netlist option), and added logging of
    timestamps.
  * moved packet receiving/replying stuff into rbldnsd.c
  * one-by-off bug - retrying interrupted replies was wrong
  * use inline version of qsort in order to be able to use inline
    comparision routine.  Speed up loading significantly.
  * allow to run as non-root; little cleanups
  * removed -DNOREMOVEDUPS, -DNOIP4RANGES, -DPRINT_TIMES => -DNOTIMES
  * added statistic counters (SIGUSR1/USR2/exit) - disable with -DNOSTATS
  * added meminfo logging via mallinfo (-m option) - disable with -DNOMEMINFO
  * fixed invocation w/o -b (bind address): rbldnsd wasn't work w/o -b at all

 -- Michael Tokarev <mjt@corpit.ru>  Sat, 19 Apr 2003 02:25:18 +0400

rbldnsd (0.82) unstable; urgency=low

  * recognize another variation of IP address range, for easy use:
    127.0.0.1-2 is now treated as 127.0.0.1-127.0.0.2
    127.0-200   is now treated as 127.0.0.0-127.200.255.255

  * rbldnsd w/o arguments will exit with 1 after printing usage info
    -h cause exit with 0
    (I forgot to add exit() call after usage())

  * example WirehubDynablock2rbldnsd.pl script

  * debianized, added startup script for Debian
    (rbldnsd is now a native Debian package)
