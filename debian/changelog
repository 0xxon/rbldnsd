rbldnsd (0.83) unstable; urgency=high

  * critical buffer overflow fix in dns query parsing code.
    Initial code (0.1 version) was right, but it was rewritten
    in 0.2 - the bug was here since 0.2!..  Ughhh!..

rbldnsd (0.83p1) unstable; urgency=low

  * -DNOSTDINT_H to use <sys/types.h> instead of <stdint.h> for uint32_t.
  * changed slightly "zone loaded" message
  * added minimal access control (-a netlist option)
  * added query log filter (-L netlist option), and added logging of
    timestamps.
  * moved packet receiving/replying stuff into rbldnsd.c
  * one-by-off bug - retrying interrupted replies was wrong
  * use inline version of qsort in order to be able to use inline
    comparision routine.  Speed up loading significantly.
  * allow to run as non-root; little cleanups
  * removed -DNOREMOVEDUPS, -DNOIP4RANGES, -DPRINT_TIMES => -DNOTIMES
  * added statistic counters (SIGUSR1/USR2/exit) - disable with -DNOSTATS
  * added meminfo logging via mallinfo (-m option) - disable with -DNOMEMINFO
  * fixed invocation w/o -b (bind address): rbldnsd wasn't work w/o -b at all

rbldnsd (0.82) unstable; urgency=low

  * recognize another variation of IP address range, for easy use:
    127.0.0.1-2 is now treated as 127.0.0.1-127.0.0.2
    127.0-200   is now treated as 127.0.0.0-127.200.255.255

  * rbldnsd w/o arguments will exit with 1 after printing usage info
    -h cause exit with 0
    (I forgot to add exit() call after usage())

  * example WirehubDynablock2rbldnsd.pl script

  * debianized, added startup script for Debian
    (rbldnsd is now a native Debian package)
