rbldnsd (0.83p1) unstable; urgency=low

  * do not free() memory for arrays on zone reloads, but reuse
    previously allocated memory (-DREUSEMEM, not enabled by default).
    This should speed up loads.

  * allow to run as non-root; little cleanups

  * added statistic counters (SIGUSR1/USR2/exit) - disable with -DNOSTATS

  * added meminfo logging via mallinfo - disable with -DNOMEMINFO

  * fixed invocation w/o -b (bind address): rbldnsd wasn't work w/o -b at all

rbldnsd (0.82) unstable; urgency=low

  * recognize another variation of IP address range, for easy use:
    127.0.0.1-2 is now treated as 127.0.0.1-127.0.0.2
    127.0-200   is now treated as 127.0.0.0-127.200.255.255

  * rbldnsd w/o arguments will exit with 1 after printing usage info
    -h cause exit with 0
    (I forgot to add exit() call after usage())

  * example WirehubDynablock2rbldnsd.pl script

  * debianized, added startup script for Debian
    (rbldnsd is now a native Debian package)
